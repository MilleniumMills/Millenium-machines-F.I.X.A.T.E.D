# Millennium Machines F.I.X.A.T.E.D Documentation

Here you'll find documentation related to the manufacture and technical specifications of all our fixtures. These specifications are only a guideline and can be modified to meet your requirements.

### - All Fixated fixture plates

**MATERIAL**           : Cast tooling plate, MIC6 or Aluminium 6061/6068 that has been milled flat.

**PROCESS**            : Laser Cut rr CNC milled.

**GENERAL TOLERANCES** :

        - Standard fit tolerances for all 4.2mm holes to be tapped later to M5.

        - Standard fit tolerances for all 5.8mm holes to be reamed later to 6mm.

        - Perimeter tolerance of -0.05mm +0mm.

        - Perimeter parallelism tolerance of 0.05mm across the 2 longest sides.

        - No given tolerance for parallelism of top and bottom faces.

        - Flatness tolerance of top and bottom 0.05mm across length and width of part.

### Notes
These plates are intended to be laser cut (using the svg files available [here](../Technical%20Drawings/Fixture%20Plates/)) or milled as blanks. All holes have been sized to be tapped and reamed by the end user to reduce costs.

Full Monty and Full Monty Slim may cause issues with material stress release during manufacture which can lead to part warping. If you do not need the use of the 6mm dowel feature, please consider using the Continental Breakfast variants instead.
