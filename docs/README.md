Welcome to fixated Docs here you'll find documentation related to the manufacture and technical specifications of all our fixtures, these specifications are only a guideline and can be modified to meet your requirements.  


##  DOCUMENTATION

### - All Fixated fixture plates 

MATERIAL           : Cast tooling plate, MIC6 or aluminium 6061/6068 that has been milled flat

PROCESS            : Laser Cut Or CNC milled 

GENERAL TOLERANCES : 
                     - Standard fit tolerances for all 4.2mm holes to be tapped later to M5

                     - Standard fit tolerances for all 5.8mm holes to be reamed later to M6 
                     
                     - Perimeter tolerance of -0.05mm +0mm 
                     
                     - Perimeter parralelism tolerance of 0.05mm acrross the 2 longest sides
                     
                     - No given tolerance for parralelism of top and bottom faces
                     
                     - Flatness tolerance of top and bottom 0.05mm across length and width of part
                   
NOTES: These plates are intended to be laser cut or milled as blanks, all holes have been sized to tapped and reamed by the end user to reduce costs. Full monty and full monty slim may cause issues with material stress release during manufacture which can lead to part warping if you do not need the use of the M6 dowel feature consider using the continental breakfast variants instead.
