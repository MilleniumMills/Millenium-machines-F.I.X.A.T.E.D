A fixture plate system designed to fit the bed of a standard-sized Milo V1.5 (500x160mm), featuring
hole spacings of 20mm on center intended for tapping to M5, and another set of holes also 20mm on center to accommodate 6mm dowel pins.

### The Full Monty (SLIM)

The Full Monty Slim covers the same features as the regular Full Monty, but its holes only cover the workable area of a standard Milo V1.5.

### The Continental Breakfast

The Full Monty's slim European cousin, this fixture plate system is designed to fit the bed of a standard-sized Milo V1.5 (500x160mm), and features hole spacings of 20mm on center intended for tapping to M5. Unlike the Full Monty, it does not include the holes for 6mm dowel pins.

### The Continental Breakfast (SLIM)
